# Yggdrasil Engine Feature Testing and Learning Branch

This branch is an entirely different version from the other branches.
Therefor the quality of the code in this branch is not meant as a representation of the final engine.
I use this branch to learn concepts and to try stuff out, even if it doesn't result in optimal results.
Most of this code will be rewritten into something more usable.
